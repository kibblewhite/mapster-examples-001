# mapster-examples-001
Because the examples/samples and documentation that Mapster provide makes little to no sense to me, what the heck is "[name]Dto" anyways? Time to find out here...

- Mapster // https://github.com/MapsterMapper/Mapster

I shall attempt to get some working examples of data mappings using Mapster working so that I can better understand how it works. I will try to explain all the DTOs used, rather than assume knowledge on your behave.

Wish me luck!
